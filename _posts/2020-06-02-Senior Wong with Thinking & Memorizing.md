Day 2 Ignore 



Day 3 Something he can't eat if only with what he has 



# Interest
Interest plays a significant role to the effectiveness of one's thinking and memorizing process, however, people tend to forget it very often. 

Here in Senior Wong's life, when he saw the triangle, he was happy, he was very interested. Why was he interested? From the first scene we know Senior Wong loves eating, so when the triangle appears in front of him, he realized he might have something to eat! This indeed is very important, this is the motivation that drives him to successfully think, understand and memorize as we will see in the later scene. 
So many times in our life some random thing: a book, a tool, a task, a person just jumps out in front of our eyes, then a random voice from somewhere came out: "Do this", "Read it, use it, finish it, talk with him". It happens so often that we even start tolerating and accepting it mindlessly as 'normal'. At the back of it, a sense of lost is ensued. NO! we have to jump up and shout out "IT IS NOT NORMAL!". 

Like Senior Wong, we should know the answer to these questions: who we are, what we are interested in, why we are interested in them. When a thing accompanied with a command invade into our life, obeying silently won't really benefit anyone, we have to pick up the gun and defend ourselves! 

We have to touch it, feel it and think about it by ourselves. For the reason if not, everything we encounter in our life, will be like Senior Wong's day 2 experience: "A lot of food? Whar are you talking about?"

# Just Thinking
## Memory retriving
In Senior Wong's Day One experience, a triangle is in his memory, but he still need some time to remember it, I mean, retrieve it. 
Part of the thinking process is memory retieving. In "How to solve it", Polya used this question to help student retrieve useful memory: "Here is the problem, can you think of a related problem?". So the next time you think about something, be generous to spare some minutes on remembering the related information. 

## Establish connection. 
The most rewarding moment for Senior Wong was when he realize the difference between his triangle the target triangle is the size, and by enlarging the size of his triangle he can get a same one as the target one. 

In "How to solve it", polya mentioned "The main achievement in the solution of a problem is to conceieve the idea of a plan". In other words, solve a problem is about seeing the connection between the known and the unknown. Another important part besides memory retrieving is connection establishment. Polya uses the following question to inspire student "Here is a problem related your prblem and solved before, can you use it?" 

Study it, I mean 'think' as you are studying it. By 'study' I mean for a scientific study, think of the nature, properties and principles of the object. I see this also involves memory retrieving. 

There are 2 cases here, one is when the study doesn't include unfamiliar external knowledge. The right cues is the king in this game. You have the right cue, you can have the right knowledge to conceive the plan. Nevertherless, it doesn't mean there is no new knowledge generated during this proess, for instance, previous knowledge point based new-emerging connection and refined understanding can still happen.

The other one is new knowledge oriented study. New knowledge focused does not indicates the old knowledge will be discarded, on the contratry, knowledge in the memory are extremely important to build a solid understanding. There are 2 types of connection being established, one is inside the new knowledge itself, organizing, chunking, working memory memorizing are required to support this. The other type is the connection between the new and old knowledge. If you lose this type of connection, even you build a super organized and firm connection inside the new knowledge, sooner or later you will experience a sense of lost.  



## Deep thinking mode
Getting into it takes time and efforts, 

Establish connection,  

# Understanding new information
Senior Wong saw something very different in Day 3. And he couldn't solve it by himself.
